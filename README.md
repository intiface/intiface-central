## How to Build

Building Intiface Central will require the following tools:

- Flutter SDK (3.27.1 or greater) and it's requirements for your platform (XCode for iOS/macOS,
  Android SDK/JDK etc for Android, etc...)
- Rust (Latest version)

To run a development version instead of making a build, switch out the `flutter build -d [target]` statements below with `flutter run [target]` (or just `flutter run` if the default platform is what you're aiming for).

### Desktop

To build for Desktop, simply run 

`flutter build`

Or, if you have multiple targets available

`flutter build -d [target]`

All platforms now build through the main build command, there is no longer a need to issue separate commands when building Android.
